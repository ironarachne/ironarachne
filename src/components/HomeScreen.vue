    <p>Welcome to Iron Arachne!</p>
    <p>
      This site lets you randomly generate content for tabletop role-playing
      games and other fictional works. I'm always tinkering with it, so come
      back every so often to see if something new's been added.
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is Ben, and I'm the author of this site and all of the tools on
      it. You can find my personal website and blog at
      <a href="https://benovermyer.com">benovermyer.com</a>. Sometimes I'll
      write about what I'm working on for Iron Arachne over there.

      If you find this site useful, please consider buying me a coffee.
