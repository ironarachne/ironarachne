# Terrain

Terrain is the orientation and nature of the ground itself.

For this, I'm using references like the following:

- [Terrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain), on Wikipedia
- [Landforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landform), on Wikipedia

Given that landforms can refer to things as big as continents or as small as waterfalls,
this structure will be used both for components of terrain and for standalone descriptors.

Landforms small enough to be a component of a terrain will be used for generating descriptions
of that terrain.
